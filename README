STDEval Version: 0.6

This directory contains the Spoken Term Detection Evaluation Toolkit
(STDEval). It was develop as the standard technology evaluation tool
for the open evaluation of Spoken Term Detection technologies.  

Version 0.1 contains a single tool, 'STDEval'.  It uses the inputs
described in the STD Evaluation plan to complete the evaluation of a
system.  A manual page, (which is built by the make process),
describes to commandline options.

INSTALLATION
------------

The tools do not implement the typical installation process of copying
files to a global binary directory.  Instead, the tools are to be run
from the base directory with the command:

  % perl -I <DIR> <DIR>/STDEval.pl ....options....

The top level make file contains a target for performing self tests.
Running the command "make check" will perform the self tests.

USAGE
-----

The release contains test files and example files in the test_suite
directory.  The 'test2.*' files comprise a complete set of input files
supplied as an example usage of the evaluation tool.  The following
command generates two reports, 'example.occ.txt' and
'example.ali.txt'.  A DET curve is also produced in the example.det.*
files which can be used with the GNUPLOT program to render the graph.
The -c option writes intermediate information to so that subsequent
executions can avoid searching the RTTM file for term occurences.

perl -I src ./src/STDEval.pl -e test_suite/test2.ecf.xml -r test_suite/test2.rttm -s test_suite/test2.stdlist.xml -t test_suite/test2.tlist.xml -A -o example.occ.txt -a example.ali.txt -d example.det -c example.cache && mv example.* ./tmp/
