v0.6 - 20061122
[ADDED]   Option to overwrite the system ID name
[FIXED]   Few bugs

v0.5 - 20061027
[ADDED]   Conditional HTML Report
[ADDED]   If the Conditional DET Curve is requested, it outputs the
           results of the DET analysis into the Conditional Occurrence
           report and the Conditional HTML Report

v0.4 - 20061026
[FIXED]   XML Schema for STDList validates NA and scientific float notation
[FIXED]   Typo in the license header (Jerome)
[FIXED]   TermList:saveFile now does the encoding properly (Jerome)
[FIXED]   Scale on DET curves (Jon)
[FIXED]   DET Curve error if no data computed (Jon)
[CHANGED] 'occurrence' is spelled correctly
[CHANGED] 'cached tag 'occurence' is now 'occurrence' (perl -pi -e "s/ccurence/ccurrence/g" *.cache) (Thanks to David Miller)

v0.3a - 20060921 
   - Modified the use of time- and score-congruence epsilons so that score has
     a bigger bearing on the alignments that time overlap.

v0.3 - 20060913

Functionality changes:  
   - Term-weighted Value is reported for all reports.
   - The DET curves previously produced were pooled DET curves over all term
     occurrences.  The curently produced DET plots, via '-d' and '-D' are now
     'Term-weighted' DET curves that are commencorate with Term Weighted Value.
     To produce a pooled DET curve, use the -P option.   
   - Beta formula changed to C/V*(1/Pterm - 1)

New Options:
   "-n" sets the number of trials per second
   "-p" sets the prior probability of a term
   "-P" produces term occurrence pooled DET curves if the -d ot -D options are used. 

[BUGFIX] System terms with "NO" decisions were erroneously included as term
         occurrences in the occurence reports.    
[BUGFIX] RTTM find occurrences code: Partially matched terms masked
   terms that immediately followed the partial term.
[BUGFIX] Scoring ECF filtering was repaired and a test was added to the test 
   suite.


v0.2:

Functionality changes:
----------------------
Reports: - The occurrence report no ignores putative term occurrences from the
           system with 'NO' hard decision values.
         - Conditioned analysis reports can be generated by selecting term sets
           via -T and source type sets via -Y.

DET Curves: - Original DET curves incorrectly computed Pmiss and Pfa.
            - Partial DET curves were implemented, i.e., systems will not
              always have responses for TARGET occurrences, and systems will
              not always generate a full set of NO decisions for putative
	      occurrences.
            - Threshold plots are generated for each DET curve
            - PNG are generated for each DET/Threshold plot


Command line Changes:
---------------------

[CHANGED] -A option replace the old -d option
[ADDED]   -o option display the occurrence report
[ADDED]   -O option display the conditional occurrence report
[ADDED]   -d option generate the DET Curve 
[ADDED]   -D option generate the conditional DET Curve
[ADDED]   -k and -K to set the coefficient of correctness to calculate the values
[CHANGED] -T, -Y, and -N options behavior

-N option is filtering the DET Curves (-d, -D) and the occurrence (-o,
   -O) reports by filename and channel.
-T option allows the creation of sets of termIDs for the conditional
   occurrence report (one set represents one row) and also for the
   conditional DET Curve.
-Y option allows the creation of sets of Source types for the
   conditional occurrence report (one set represents one column) and also
   for the conditional DET Curve.
